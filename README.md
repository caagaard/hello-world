# hello-world

I'm making my first git repository, and my can't believe this isn't used more widely
So much group project trauma in college could have been avoided with branches.
Actually, it couldn't.
The guy who would have done the merge flaking out might have actually been worse 
Or maybe it's not so bad.  I don't really know how this works with multiple users yet.
